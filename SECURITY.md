# Security Policy

SponsorBlock, SponsorLock and SponsorBlock Server are known to have
no intentional security vulnerabilities. If reported, vulnerabilities
will be fixed in the shortest time possible, with minimal impact possible.

## Supported Versions

#### Browser add-on

The versions published on the Chrome and Mozilla web stores are supported.

#### Server

The latest build is supported.

#### Helper bots

The latest builds are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

However, if you can fix it yourself, fix it yourself first and then
propose a PR at the relevant repository. There is no fast track
for getting security bugs fixed urgently. They are still prioritised
like other bugs.
